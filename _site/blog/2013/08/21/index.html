        		<h2>Reflections About Personal Change</h2>



<p>21 August 2013</p>
<div>
<p>One thing that I've been thinking about lately is personal change. There were two things in particular that made me reflect more about this subject. First of all, while studying at BYU, I learned about <a href="http://foreverfamilies.byu.edu/Article.aspx?a=12">transitional characters</a>. These are people who have overcome their past and revolve not repeat the bad family patterns in which they were raised. Also, more recently in my Family and Divorce Mediation class, we were discussing the different approaches to conflict that people have. In both cases, the professors noted that this change, whether it be changing family patterns or how we handle conflict, requires being conscious of what we are currently doing and making an intentional decision to act differently.</p>

<p>As I thought about how important it is to be mindful of myself, I started wondering if it was a requirement for <em>all</em> personal change. I have noticed that as I have been mindful of something that I am doing wrong, I am much more likely to change it. If I am unaware of it, then it seems like it just doesn't exist. I am powerless to change something if I have no idea it exists, let alone whether it is good or bad or needs to be changed.</p>

<p>I noticed that there are many things that I do to avoid being aware of myself. Being defensive is one way, becoming obsessively involved in things is another. In both cases, they keep the focus away from myself. They keep me from examining my actions, which, ultimately, also keeps me from changing them.</p>

<p>At times, it seems that seeing my faults will be more than I can handle, and I run from it. When I actually allow myself to become aware of my actions and evaluate the worthiness of them, however, I realize that it really isn't that bad. I mean, sometimes I feel really bad about things I have done, but as I reflect upon how unsatisfied I am with them, it makes it easy to resolve to change it. And this brings me peace. Something about the fact of becoming aware of my shortcomings brings a natural resolve to correct it. As an additional benefit, I get a lot less defensive because I no longer feel threatened that somebody will potentially bring up something (weaknesses) I am trying to hide from.</p>

<p>This all makes me wonder if all personal change depends on one's ability to be aware of his or her self and make deliberate corrective action. It makes sense.</p>
