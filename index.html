<p><img width="350" border="5" alt="Michael and family" style="position:relative; float:right; border-color:#FFFFFF; margin-left:10px" class="shadow" src="images/family.jpg">Hey there, thanks for stopping by to learn more about me. My name is Michael, and I am a graduate student earning my MS in Marital and Family Therapy at <a href="http://www.llu.edu">Loma Linda University</a>. I love learning about families and studying the theories that seek to make sense of why families do what they do. My project, <a href="http://www.familytherapedia.com">familytherapia.com</a>, is a Wikipedia-style site where I have tried to organize these family concepts and theories in a way that is easy for anybody to learn.</p>
<p>I also love languages and translation. I currently speak English (obviously) and Portuguese fluently and Spanish fluently as well, although it lags behind the other two a bit. I am a freelance translator between English and Portuguese since 2005. In case you are interested in translating between these two languages, you can check out the <a href="/translation">translation</a> part of the site. Also, if you need a translation done within my area of specialty, feel free to <a href="&#109&#097&#105&#108&#116&#111&#058&#109&#064&#109&#112&#097&#046&#109&#101">email me</a> for a quote.</p>
<p>I've tried to design the site so that you could have easy access to all the places that you can find me online, such as <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1008007812">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/michael-albright/1a/172/124">LinkedIn</a>. I've also included some of the projects that I'm currently (and slowly) working on, such as <a href="http://www.familytherapedia.com">familytherapia.com</a> mentioned above, and <a href="http://www.albrightfamily.org">albrightfamily.org</a>, which is dedicated to my own family's history. </p>
<p>Hopefully, you will find this site useful for whatever purposes you hoped to achieve when you visited it. If you're interested in learning more about me, you can do so <a href="/aboutme">here</a>. Please <a href="&#109&#097&#105&#108&#116&#111&#058&#109&#064&#109&#112&#097&#046&#109&#101">contact me</a> if you have any questions or suggestions about me or what I do. Thanks again for stopping by!</p>
