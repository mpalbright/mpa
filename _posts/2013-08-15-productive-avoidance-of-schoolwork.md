intro: I have two large papers to do in less than two weeks. One is on a group process class that I had during a week in June, and the other is about conflict resolution. I am really torturing myself about these assignments.

I have two large papers to do in less than two weeks. One is on a group process class that I had during a week in June, and the other is about conflict resolution. I am really torturing myself about these assignments.

One thing I have learned about myself, however, is that I am most productive when I have a big project looming -- only not productive where I *need* to be. For instance, today I transferred our gas and electric bills, paid a parking ticket, checked on our health insurance status, and updated our address with immigration authorities. I was certainly productive, but *not* on my paper where I needed it most. The gains on my stinking 30-to-40-page paper were negligible, and it is due on Friday. I'm setting myself up for a stressful end of the week.

Shirley and I got a babysitter for the kids and went out to couples counseling tonight. When we got there, the whole place was closed. I'm thinking that the secretary forgot to schedule us for this week. We went ahead and took advantage of the time by going to the park and talking a bit, and then getting a mango smoothie with boba (black tapioca balls that you suck through a big fat straw) and doing some grocery shopping at Stater Brothers. It was a good evening, but it would have been better had I been not so tired and down because of this stress with my schoolwork.
